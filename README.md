# 🐹 Golang Voyage 🚀

Hello, world! 🌍  
This is my personal logbook as I explore the fantastic (and occasionally frustrating) world of **Go (Golang)** programming.

---

## 📚 What is this?

A humble repo where I:
- Learn Go step by step
- Break things on purpose (sometimes by accident 😅)
- Build random stuff to practice
- Document my journey from "WTF is a goroutine?" to "Hey, this actually works!"

---

## 📌 Topics I'm learning

✅ Variables and types  
✅ Loops and conditionals  
✅ Functions and methods  
✅ Structs and interfaces  
✅ Pointers without fear  
✅ Goroutines that run faster than me on Mondays 🏃‍♂️💨  
🔜 Channels & concurrency  
🔜 Web APIs with net/http  
🔜 Mini projects for practice
